**WordPress has a serious problem with notifications.** Don't believe me? Take a look at this page:

This is at the top of my list with WordPress frustrations at the moment. It's just poor UX. I get that we need **some** sort of notification system, but the problem is that WordPress gives too much freedom to plugin developers to easily abuse it with no limits.

That's why **Notification Centre** is my top plugin of the week. It's a nice simple solution to the UX problem, while keeping the notifications in tact and not just hiding them altogether. There's room for improvement, since it doesn't clean up **all** notifications, but you can't always account for every use-case in an ecosystem like WordPress's. Give it a try and you'll probably find some relief from getting dizzy with red, green, and blue messages every time you log in.
