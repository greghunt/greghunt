I like to think of myself is a TRULY full stack web developer:

- Almost 20 years experience in graphic and web design
- Over a decade experience in frontend development
- 7 years experience as a backend web developer
- Over a decade in digital marketing
- 5 years as a CTO
- Developped and launched several SaaS products entirely myself.

I lead a team of talented web developers who innovate and streamline web technology to enhance the functionality and UX of our clientsâ€™ websites.

WORDPRESS DESIGN & DEVELOPMENT ðŸ”¹ WEBSITE SECURITY & MAINTENANCE

Every brand needs the right technology to tell their story.

As a Full Stack Developer with a graphic design background, I consider every project from a design, UX and platform technology angle. The team I lead is careful to balance form with function, resulting in sites that intuitively flow while supporting our clientsâ€™ goals.

This approach is at the heart of Motto, and how we help our clients succeed.

When away from the office, I still think about technology. To date Iâ€™ve developed five Wordpress Plugins (Sidebar Menu Items, Blaze CSS, Classroom, No Format Shortcode, Project Donations) and popular databases like the Oakparks.org plant library and Clippabl.
